        <h2>UWO on Foursquare</h2>
        <p>All you need is a smartphone and an opportunity to stroll around the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh. UW Oshkosh now features a page on Foursquare, a social media site leveraging location. Foursquare allows users to roam wherever they are, “check in” at different spots, such as restaurants, stores, parks and museums, and claim badges. The badges can offer points, rewards and even, depending on the volume of check-ins, mayorships.</p>
        <p>Here are the five badges you can earn on the UWO campus and how to unlock them:</p>
